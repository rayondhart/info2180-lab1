 <h2>Rayon Hart</h2>
 <p>Welcome to my webpage! I would describe myself as quite jovial and quirky. I am from a large community in St. Catherine called Kitson Town where I grew up in a small close-knit family. 
    I enjoy dancing, singing, watching anime and going on adventures. In the future I would like to work in Database Management or Cybersecurity. To be honest Web Development has been the best coding decipline I have been learning learning so far because of of how easy it is compared to working on the backend, and it is more fun to maneuver.
